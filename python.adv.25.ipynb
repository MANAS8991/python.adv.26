    "Line Chart: A line chart is a basic plotting technique that shows the closing prices of a stock over a specific time period. It provides a simple visual representation of the stock's price trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Candlestick Chart: A candlestick chart, also known as an OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) chart, provides more detailed information about the stock's price movements. Each candlestick represents a specific time period and displays the opening, closing, highest, and lowest prices for that period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bar Chart: A bar chart is similar to a candlestick chart but uses vertical bars to represent the price range. Each bar indicates the highest and lowest prices for a specific time period, with a horizontal line indicating the opening or closing price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving Average: Moving averages are used to smooth out price data and identify trends. Techniques like Simple Moving Average (SMA) or Exponential Moving Average (EMA) can be plotted as lines on the chart to highlight long-term or short-term price trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Volume Chart: Volume charts represent the trading volume of a stock over a given time period. It is typically displayed as a bar chart below the price chart and helps to identify periods of high or low trading activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical Indicators: Various technical indicators, such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Bollinger Bands, can be plotted on the stock market chart. These indicators provide additional insights into market trends, momentum, and overbought/oversold conditions.\n",

    "Overlay Plots: Multiple data series can be overlaid on a single chart to compare different stocks, market indices, or indicators. This allows for the visual analysis of relationships and correlations between different variables."

A legend helps users identify which line or plot corresponds to each specific data series. It provides clarity and avoids confusion when interpreting the data.\n",

    "Understanding Chart Components: Stock market charts can include various components, such as moving averages, trendlines, or support/resistance levels. A legend helps users understand the purpose and significance of these components, enabling them to make informed decisions based on the chart analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharing and Collaboration: When sharing stock market charts with others, a legend makes it easier for viewers to understand the chart's content, even if they are not familiar with the specific data or symbols used. It facilitates effective communication and collaboration among traders, analysts, or investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessibility and User Experience: Including a legend improves the overall user experience of interacting with the stock market chart. It reduces the cognitive load on viewers by providing clear and concise information about the data, enhancing the chart's accessibility and usability."

For example, if your DataFrame has a daily frequency, you can downsample it to a monthly frequency using the following code:\n",
    "downsampled_df = df.resample('M').mean()\n",
    "Slicing by Row Index: If your DataFrame is ordered by date and has a numeric index, you can slice the DataFrame using integer indexing to select a specific number of rows within a year. For example, to select the first 365 rows (assuming daily data), you can use the following code\n",
